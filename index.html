							<b><big>What are my interests in IT? Was there a particular event or person that piqued my interest? Do I have an experience in IT?</big></b>
								<aside>
									I am a younger person who grew up with technology being readily available, for both leisure and education, so I have grown up to be pretty comfortable with computers and technology in general. My interests started from computer games as a child, really liking car racing games and runescape, this turned into a passion for keeping up to date with the next up and coming technology hardware and software, but more in particularly computer hardware. My  IT experience started at home, where I ordered computer parts and built my computer from scratch, which I found so rewarding, after helping friends do the same I eventually found work at my uncles work, programming a C&C machine via G-code.

								<b><big>A description (in your own words) of the position, and particularly what makes this position appealing to you:</big></b>
									<aside>
										This junior data analyst role offered from Atos is a role where you will be trained for 6months, and then be mentored by an IT professional with over 16+ years in the field, whilst being mentored you will learn how to analyse data for the customers you are representing.
										<br>
										This role is interesting to me as I want to enter a role similar to this, where you are analysing the businesses you’re contracted to, finding ways to improve efficiency, whether they are minute or big-scale changes. I find business analytics interesting in that aspect, being able to make small changes which have rippling effects throughout the whole company, a few changes can flip a company who is struggling into one striving for success once again.

							<section>
								<b><big>A description of the skills, qualifications and experience required for this position:</big></b>
									<aside>
										Atos need an employee who has a background in business analytics/information technology who is able to work in teams as well as an individual efficiently. The employee must also be able to articulate themselves both orally and written, be able to learn new technologies and be proficient in them, as well as be a proven problem solver.
									</aside>

								<br>
							<section>
								<b><big>A description of my qualifications and experience relevant to this role:</big></b>
									<aside>
										Currently I am a way off from being a suitable applicant for this role, I will need to complete further tertiary study in the field to fulfill the requirements Atos desires in a potential candidate. I have had experience working in an environment where deadlines had to be met and problem solving was exercised daily to meet those deadlines, I have also picked up new technology (G-code) quickly and was able to deal with customers and talk them through the process whenever I was designing something for them. 
									</aside>
							</section>
								<br>
							<section>
								<b><big>How do I plant on obtaining the skills, qualifications and experience required for this position:</big></b>
									<aside>
										Mainly I need to finish my tertiary learning, after which I will try to get a job in a similar field to get some more work experience, whether that be as an IT consultant to gain more customer service experience, or maybe as a data analyst in a smaller company part time or at a lower level.

									<br>
									Mediators are usually perceived as quiet, reserved and shy, but have passion for the things they hold close to their hearts of have values for. They are better at listening than speaking, and can be easily overwhelmed if spread too thin trying to do too many things at once, often going into a recluse state.
									<br>
									Mediators are often optimistic people, always looking for the good in people, no matter the situation, they also take a democratic approach to things, seeing value in everyone’s input, as well as working hard themselves for a passionate cause, often being creative, offering wildly different abstract ideas compared to others in the group.

									Pragmatists need to have a hands-on approach, and learn much easier and retain attention a lot more by being able to see something tangible. Abstract concepts are often lost on pragmatists unless they are walked through exactly how the idea works and functions, they often lose focus with lengthy discussions, unless there are visual aids. 
									<br>
									Learning methods which suit pragmatists the most include: 
									<br>
									- Practicals
									<br>
									- Case studies
									<br>
									- Problem setting questions 
									<br>
									- Interactive discussions

									Auditory learners are those who learn by hearing and listening, they tend to learn better and are able to consolidate information in their memory better when things are said out loud, rather than if they read it in their heads. Auditory learners need to hear things, not just see things when taking in information efficiently.

									<b><big>Analysis:</b></big>
									<br>
									The tests varied quite a bit, the Myers-Brigg’s say that I am a mediator who is good at working in groups and values the input of everyone and thinks everyone has something valuable to give. The EMTRAIN test said I was more of a hands-on learner, who learns most effectively from being able to see something tangible when learning. Lastly, the EducationPlanner.org said the opposite of EMTRAIN, where it says I am more of an auditory learner, conflicting with the EMTRAIN results. My analysis from all this, is that I have the ability to learn in many styles, whether that be visually seeing something on a board and writing it down, or having a discussion with someone and consolidating information that way. 
									<br>
									Being classed as a mediator sounds like an ideal person to work with in a group setting, as being able to think of abstract ideas may bring something new to the project, or even spark some more discussion on things previously not covered, as well as seeing value in everyone’s input, will make fellow team members feel welcomed and hopefully work at the best of their capabilities.  The results of the other two tests provided show me to be able to learn and be productive in multiple styles of environments, which is a great asset to have in a team environment where compositions and environments are bound to change. 
									<br>
									When forming a team myself, I will have to make sure I have someone who is able to lead the project, as results say I would be most suited to the role that makes sure everyone’s voice is heard and everyone gets along with each other ensuring a harmonious working environment.

							<b><big>What is Skaterverse?</b></big>
								<aside>
									Skateboarding used to be a very popular sport/hobby amongst teens and young adults alike, but the sport took a dip in popularity in the mid 2000’s, and the popularity and interest of skateboarding as a whole has slowly decreased ever since. Skateboarding is a fantastic sport which promotes a community based approach, skaters cant just skate street spots, as it is a regular occurrence that skaters are running into trouble by skating on private property, Skaterverse would hopefully promote the skating of spots that won’t get skaters in trouble or make the sport look any worse than it is perceived in the public eye. This app will hopefully start a trend in skateboarding, increasing the interest in general, which in turn, will hopefully garner enough notability from the government to invest more money into skate parks.
									<br>
									Skaterverse will be an app designed for mobile use, the photos and locations will hopefully use the phones inbuilt GPS location as a guide, but skaters can pinpoint exactly where each spot is for each post. The app will have a map feature, which will be a zoomed-out photo of your local area by default, with pins tagging the many spots the local skaters would have uploaded. Skaters who use the app can also “check” into locations and rate the location, which will be visible for the community when scrolling through, as they will see what spots are popular, and also potentially if skaters are there currently, promoting social activity as well. If skaters would like to look for spots further away, or maybe are going for a road trip, you can seamlessly drag the map and see the other spots that have been pinned, and whilst scrolling, will see what spots are most commonly visited or highest rated within the visible map. Additionally, a levelling up system will promote further exploration for skateboarding and will keep skaters more interested in the sport/hobby, they will earn XP towards their next level by checking into spots, rating spots they have skated, and commenting. Achievements will also be added into the app, which will grant even more XP, but will be one off instances, some of these achievements may include; going to multiple spots in one day, being the first person to upload a new spot (would have to get upvotes for legitimacy), skating a spot which is more than 25km from your home, etc. The goal with adding a levelling up system will be to further increase the popularity of skateboarding, and promote skaters to try different spots in places they may not have been before. Rewards for levelling up may include special offers from local skateboarding shops (promoting local sales) or discounts or deals from the Skaterverse personal merch store. The Skaterverse will be in contact with local/online stores to promote traffic to their site, and for deals on the Skaterverse merch, as well as general upkeep of the sight, the app will run advertisements, as its main source of income, as the app will be free. 

								</aside>
						</section>
							<br>
						<section>
							<b><big>How will this be achieved?</b></big>
								<aside>
									The app would be created with the use of Appery.io, a cloud-based app builder which can make apps for both android and ios. Users would require a phone to use the app in its native form, but the app will also be viewable on desktops via web browser, it just may not be as intuitive as the mobile app, which will have most of the funding. 
									<br>
									Only basic coding skills will be required to create the app, as it only has 5 basic elements such as: A map with pins (GPS location required), able to attached comments and photos to said pins, personal profiles, and a levelling up system, as well as links to places, shops, etc.
								</aside>
						</section>
							<br>
						<section>
							<b><big>What is the end goal for Skaterverse?</b></big>
								<aside>
									The project will be successful if users are regularly using it, the brand Skaterverse as a whole grows and we can expand to possibly have an in-app game (around skateboarding) where being a higher level will unlock more items in-game. The main purpose of the app is to help skateboarding become more popular again and get it out of the stigma that skaters are a destructive community. Skateboarding has always been about finding spots with friends and making new ones along the way, and with Skaterverse this could be a reality.
